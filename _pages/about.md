I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Tübingen working in the [Geometric Analysis, Differential Geometry and Relativity Theory](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/mathematics/department/research-chairs/geometric-analysis-differential-geometry-and-relativity-theory/) group under the supervision of [Prof. Gerhard Huisken](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/mathematik/fachbereich/forschung-arbeitsbereiche/geometrische-analysis-differentialgeometrie-und-relativitaetstheorie/personen/prof-dr-gerhard-huisken/). My research lies in the interface between **differential geometry** and **partial differential equations**, where most of the problems arising in **mathematical physics** are given a mathematical formulation and can be tackled. 

Before my doctoral studies, I completed a master's degree in Tübingen and a bachelor's degree at the University of the Basque Country. Do not hesitate to contact me for a full CV!
