I am a PhD student in mathematics at University of Tübingen working under the supervision of *Prof. Gerhard Huisken*. Broadly speaking, my research focuses on **Differential Geometry**, **Partial Differential Equations** and **Mathematical Physic**. Some of the topics I am interested in are:
- **Geometric flows** such as Ricci flow or Mean curvature flow.
- **Geometric variational problems:** minimal surfaces, spectral geometry, the Yamabe problem and Yang–Mills connections.
- **General Relativity:** scalar curvature, positive energy theorems and foliations.
