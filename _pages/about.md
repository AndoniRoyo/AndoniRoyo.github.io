I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Tübingen working in the [Geometric Analysis, Differential Geometry and Relativity Theory](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/mathematics/department/research-chairs/geometric-analysis-differential-geometry-and-relativity-theory/) group. My research lies in the interface between **differential geometry** and **partial differential equations**, where most of the problems arising in **mathematical physics** are given a mathematical formulation and can be tackled. 

Before my PhD, I completed a master's degree in *Mathematical Physics* at Tübingen and a bachelor's degree in *Physics* at the University of the Basque Country. Do not hesitate to contact me for a full CV!
